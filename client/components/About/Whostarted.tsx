            Espresso Organic was born out of a simple yet bold idea â€” to create
            a coffee culture rooted in passion, sustainability, and
            authenticity. What began as a humble venture in 2013 has now
            inspired thousands of aspiring baristas and coffee lovers across
            Nepal.

            Our founder and chairman, <strong>Man Bahadur Shrestha</strong>, a
            lifelong coffee enthusiast, envisioned a space where quality meets
            community. His commitment to education, organic sourcing, and
            genuine hospitality shaped Espresso Organic into what it is today.
